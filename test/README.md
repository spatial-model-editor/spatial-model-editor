# Tests

## C++ tests

The C++ tests are located in the same place as the corresponding source files:
each component `X` has
- a header file `X.hpp`
- a source file `X.cpp`
- a tests source file `X_t.cpp`.

They can be ran with

```
make test
```

Alternatively you can get more output and select which tests to run by passing command line arguments directly to the test executable.

For example to exclude tests tagged with `[gui]`, show successful tests results (`-s`), and abort at the first failed test (`-a`):

```
./test/tests -as "~[gui]"
```

Or to list (without running) all tests that are tagged `[simulate]` and not tagged `[gui]`:

```
./test/tests -l "[simulate]~[gui]"
```

See the Catch2 [command-line documentation](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md#top) for more options.

Note: currently the GUI tests are only intended for use on linux,
and the mouse and keyboard should not be used while the tests are running
,as this can interfere with the simulated mouse and keyboard events generated by the test.

## Python tests

The python tests are in [../sme/test](../sme/test), and can be ran from this directory with

```
python -m unittest -v
```

The Docstrings also contain example code snippets along with the expected output in doctest format,
which can be tested with

```
python sme_doctest.py -v
```
