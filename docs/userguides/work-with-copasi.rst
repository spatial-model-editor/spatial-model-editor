Work with SBML and COPASI models 
=================================

You can use SME to turn non-spatial ODE models created with COPASI or SBML into spatial models. This guide will show you how to do this. If you haven't already, start by reading through the `gui overview <gui-overview.html>`_, because many of the workflows described there are useful here, too.
