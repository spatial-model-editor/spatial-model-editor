Python Interface
================

A Python interface is available, which can be installed with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sme

.. note::

    If your python version or platform is not supported, please file an `issue <https://github.com/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/issues/new>`_

Once it is installed, you should be able to import the module

.. code-block:: python

    $ python
    Python 3.8.2 (default, Mar  5 2020, 21:13:34)
    [GCC 9.2.1 20191008] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import sme
    >>> print(sme)
    <module 'sme' from 'sme.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so'>

To get help on how to use it, type ``help(sme)`` to get started.

.. tip ::

    There is also an online `colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/lkeegan/spatial-model-editor/blob/master/sme/sme_getting_started.ipynb>`_ notebook where you can try it out in your browser without installing anything on your computer.
