How to read this documentation
-------------------------------
Welcome to the spatial-model-editor (SME)!
This documentation is divided into three main parts. Of those, the 'Getting started' section is the most important one that every new user should work through. It will teach you how to create a new model in SME, and you will become familiar with all important functions the software has to offer along the way. 

The second part, 'Userguides', is a collection of more specialized articles that treat specific use cases. Have a look at them after you read the 'Getting started' section. 

Finally, the 'Reference documentation' section contains more detailed information about the inner workings of SME. Treat this as a library in which you can look up specific information whenever you need it.

The 'Developer documentation' section is only relevant if you intend to contribute to SME's source code. It contains information about the code structure and how to run and add tests.
