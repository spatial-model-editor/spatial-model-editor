Assign Compartments
===================

After importing a geometry image, each compartment can be assigned a region in the image:

* click on the compartment name
* click on "Select compartment geometry..."
* then click on the desired part of the image.

The compartment geometry will then be made up from all of the pixels in the image of the chosen colour.
